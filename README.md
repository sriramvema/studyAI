# StudyAI

This project is a React web application that uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to pull information from uploaded PDFs. I used the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Huggingface to perform the RAG procedures. This application's primary use is for students to receive study help in their classes, which is specifically tailored to the material given to them. Once they upload a PDF of their class notes or textbook, each page is loaded into the RAG function and outputs the relevant pages for whatever the student's question is. These pages are given to a Claude model as context to answer the user's question. For this project, I used the claude-3-haiku-20240307 model. I have provided a link below to view a short demo I have prepared of the web app.

## Backend

In order to run the backend, Go into the api directory in your terminal and run 
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 
This will install the necessary libraries for the program. Then run the backend with the command 
```python app.py``` 
This will have the backend up and running.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
